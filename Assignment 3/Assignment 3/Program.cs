/* This program is a farming simulator. It was made for GD47's Programming 1
    Assignment 3. It should take in several forms of input from the player, 
    things like: what to plant, what to water, what to feed, what to harvest.
    Not 100% sure what the interface will look like, but we'll try stuff out.
    It was made by Ali, Dayton Ruhl, Rajan.
